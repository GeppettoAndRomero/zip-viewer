# Security Policy

`zip-viewer` runs entirely in your browser. There is no server component and no
account system, so your images are never uploaded. Most classic web vulnerabilities
(server-side injection, auth bypass, data exfiltration via a backend) do not apply.

We still take client-side security seriously — XSS, supply-chain issues in
dependencies, a service worker caching bug, or anything that could cause a file to
leave your device.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately, not in a public issue:

- Email: **security@runlocally.app**
- Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security → Report a vulnerability).

Include what you found, steps to reproduce, and the impact you expect. We aim to
acknowledge within a few days. Please give us a reasonable window to ship a fix
before public disclosure.

## Scope

In scope:

- This repository's source and the deployed site.
- The conversion pipeline (decode/encode), the service worker, and the PWA manifest.
- Anything that could send image data or metadata off the device.

Out of scope:

- Findings that require a compromised device or a malicious browser extension.
- Missing hardening headers that have no concrete exploit.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
